</list><para id="eip-113">A copyright is an intellectual property right granted by a government to the author of an original literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, or other eligible creative work that gives him or her the exclusive right to control how the work is published, reproduced, performed, or displayed—as well as whether or not derivative works (e.g., a movie version of a novel) may be produced.
</para><para id="eip-645">In the United States, the legal foundation for copyright is set forth, along with that for patents, in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution. This clause gives Congress the authority to “promote the progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.”<footnote id="footnote1"> 
U.S. Constitution Arr. 1, § 8
</footnote></para><para id="eip-589">Congress and the courts have interpreted the terms “authors” and “writings” very broadly so as to include the creators of a wide variety of artistic and intellectual works. Title 17 of the United States Code authorizes the grant of a copyright to the  authors of “original works of authorship”— including literary works, dramatic works, choreographic works,  graphic works, audiovisual works, sound recordings, and architectural works. In most cases, a copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.</para></section><section id="eip-297"><title>How to Obtain a Copyright</title><para id="eip-713">
In America, the copyright system is administered by the U.S. Copyright Office, which is part of the Library of Congress and maintains a registry of copyrighted works.  Interestingly, registration is not required to obtain a copyright. It is automatically granted to an author at the moment of creation—i.e., as soon as his or her work is expressed in a tangible form that allows it to be seen or copied, such as being written on paper or on a computer, or recorded as video or audio. Registration is only required if a copyright holder wants to initiate a copyright infringement suit in federal court.
</para></section><section id="eip-612"><title>Copyrights vs. Patents</title><para id="eip-965">
Unlike the case with patents, the United States never developed an examination system for determining whether or not a creative work merits copyright protection. That’s because while the validity of an invention can be evaluated fairly objectively based on its utility, novelty, and non- obviousness, the merit of any cultural work is a far more subjective affair, as demonstrated by the frequency with which publishers reject novels that later go on to become literary classics.
</para><para id="eip-33">What the patent and copyright systems share, however, is the recognition that unless the inherent property rights of inventors and authors to their creations are protected, the wellsprings of creation and productivity would be negatively affected by the reduced incentive. Both systems also share the public policy goal of marshaling the benefits of individual creativity—whether technological, as in the case of inventions, or cultural, as in literary works—to the public good so that these promote the progress of the nation and the “general welfare” of its citizens.</para><para id="eip-570">How to promote that general welfare, however, was approached very differently by the Founders in the case of patents than it was with copyright.</para><para id="eip-600">The explicit intention of patent law, explained Supreme Court Justice Henry Baldwin in <emphasis><foreign>Whitney v. Emmett</foreign> (1831)</emphasis>, was “to benefit the inventor, in the belief that maximizing individual welfare leads to maximum social welfare.” Inventors, after all, created tools that enabled the new nation to free itself from dependency on foreign imports and develop industries of its own. Whatever incentives were needed to prod these technologically creative people to take on the challenge and succeed were well worth the bargain (see <emphasis>Chapter 1</emphasis>).</para></section><section id="eip-307"><title>The Rights of Authors and the Public Interest</title><para id="eip-340">
When it came to copyright, however, the rights of authors were thought to conflict with those of the public to a far greater extent. “Democratic values emphasized equal and widespread access to learning and the importance of information flows for maintaining political freedom, whereas strong copyrights impinged on the fullest attainment of these objectives,” notes Bowdoin College historian Zorina Khan, author of  <foreign>The Democratization of Invention: Patents and Copyright in American Economic Development,</foreign> which won the Alice Hanson Jones prize for outstanding work in economic history in 2005.<footnote id="footnote2">

</para><para id="eip-461">As an example, a copyright owner’s right to prevent unauthorized use of his work may at times be constrained by the public’s First Amendment right of free speech—hence the doctrine of “fair use” (more on this later).</para><para id="eip-796">It was believed that a strategy of strong patent rights but weaker copyrights also better reflected the differing incentives that motivated inventors and authors. Inventors, many felt, were driven primarily by economic gain, whereas authors were often interested as much in the prospect of celebrity and reputation as they were in monetary reward.</para><para id="eip-509">Supreme Court Justice John McLean emphasized that this distinction between patents and copyrights exists in the structure of U.S. intellectual property law itself. In <emphasis>Wheaton  v. Peters (1834)</emphasis>, the first high court ruling on copyright, he wrote:
<preformat id="eip-id1690984">
       “It has been argued at the bar that as the
        promotion of the progress of science and 
        the useful arts is here united in the same 
        clause in the Constitution, the rights of 
        authors and inventors were considered as 
        standing on the same footing. But this, I 
        think, is a non-sequitur … for when 
        Congress came to execute this power by 
        legislation, the subjects are kept distinct
        and very different provisions are made 
        respecting them.”<footnote id="footnote3">

<item>Appreciate the degree to which authors’ rights were ignored at that time.</item>
</list><para id="eip-326">As was the case with patents, the granting of book privileges (now called copyrights) began in the Republic of Venice in the fifteenth century. Prior to that, printed books were considered part of the public domain and anyone could copy or reproduce them. But in 1492—the same year Columbus sailed the Santa Maria to the New World—a Milanese author named Donatus Bossius petitioned the sixth duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Sforza, for an exclusive  privilege  for his book, arguing that without such a privilege he would be unjustly deprived of the fruit of his effort. He was granted a ten-year privilege, and the practice soon spread throughout Europe.
</para><para id="eip-974">The French copyright system was introduced in 1498. Exclusive rights to not only books but also translations, maps, type designs, engravings, and artwork were granted by the monarch for periods initially ranging from two to ten years. There were stipulations attached to such grants, sometimes including even price controls on the published works.</para><para id="eip-756">It is important to realize, however, that authorship was not required for the granting of early copyrights. In fact, the early copyright systems of Europe more often than not enabled printers and publishers to establish quite effective monopolies over the commerce in books, the arts, and other cultural works that limited the diffusion of culture in society. The owners of such privileges may have waxed poetic about “droit d’auteur” (authors’ rights), but this was often just a way of deflecting public criticism of their monopolistic power and superprofits.</para><para id="eip-768">Indeed, this was most glaringly revealed in the grant of exclusive privileges to French opera. According to a 1929 book by Henry Prunières,<footnote id="footnote4"> 
Henry Prunières, <foreign>“La vie illustre et libertine de
Jean-Baptiste Lully,”</foreign> Librairie Plon, Paris, 1929,
courtesy of B. Zorina Khan.
</footnote> 
Louis XIV in 1669 granted a perpetual monopoly  over all operatic performances  in  France to Jean-Baptiste Lully, the director of the Paris Opera. Lully also gained sole publication rights to opera librettos, and sold shares in the rights to printers. He then used his copyright privilege to limit the number of musicians who could perform outside the Paris Opera and to suppress competitors like the Comédie Francaise. In the end, Lully became fabulously rich and bequeathed his monopoly rights to his heirs.
</para><para id="eip-972">Not exactly your starving artist asking merely to enjoy the fruits of his work.</para><para id="eip-176">Early copyright systems also quickly evolved into means of censorship and surveillance of the population’s reading habits. The 1566 Edict of Moulins in France, for example, required that any new book had to be approved and licensed by the Crown. Manuscripts first had to be read and approved by a censor before a permit was granted to print a book. The permit could be revoked if officials or influential citizens later complained about the book’s content.</para><para id="eip-449">Interestingly, a decree in 1777 enabled  authors who did not sell off their rights to gain a copyright in perpetuity. But like the A. J. Liebling quote about freedom of the press belonging only to those with enough wealth to own one, so, too, were authors’ inalienable rights often just a lofty theory trumped by harsh economic reality. Because few authors had the capital required to print a book, they usually sold off their “exclusive rights” to commercial publishers.</para><para id="eip-390">Much the same situation prevailed in the English copyright system, where copyright law began as a monopoly grant to benefit favored guilds and as a means to censor public opinion on behalf of the Crown.</para><para id="eip-832"><title>The Statute of Anne</title>In 1557, the Worshipful Company of Stationers was granted a royal privilege that enabled it to control the book trade for the next 150 years. Only in 1709 did a new copyright statute, the <emphasis>Statute of Anne</emphasis>, begin to erode the monopolistic power of the Stationers Company. It stipulated that a copyright could be obtained by anyone, and instead of a perpetual right, the term was limited to 14 years with the right to renew for one additional 14-year term. According to Professor John Feather of Loughborough University in Britain, the statute “wholly ignored the authors of books, and certainly was not intended to confer any additional rights on them.”<footnote id="footnote5">

</footnote></para><para id="eip-268">Assessing early European copyright systems as a whole, Zorina Khan observes that they “resulted in ‘odious monopolies,’ higher prices and greater scarcity, large transfers [of money] to officials of the Crown and their allies, and pervasive censorship [while it also] disadvantaged smaller book producers, provincial publishers, and the academic and broader community.”<footnote id="footnote6"> 
Op. cit., Khan.
</footnote></para><para id="eip-553">It wasn’t until 1774 in England, in the landmark case <foreign>Donaldson v.  Beckett,</foreign> that a court ruled  that  authors have a fundamental right to their writings—at least until publication, after which the Statute of Anne still gave the rights to the publishers. The immediate claim in the case was whether Scottish bookseller Alexander Donaldson had acted as a pirate when he published an edition of James Thomson’s <foreign>The Seasons,</foreign> a work for which Thomas Beckett and other London booksellers claimed the copyright. But the larger principle at issue was whether copyright was a limited right granted by government under the Statute of Anne, or a common law right of publishers that existed in perpetuity despite the limitations of the statute.</para><para id="eip-466">The case would prove pivotal in deciding not only the future of publishing, but also of authors, in whose name the London publishers claimed to be acting. The court took the claim of authors’ rights further than the publishers ever intended, however. It reaffirmed the limited statutory nature of copyright and also recognized that authors—with the decline of patronage, authors were only then emerging as independent professionals writing for a mass market of book buyers—were the true originators and proprietors of the product of their own creative labors.</para><para id="eip-478">As Michel Foucault would put it nearly two centuries later,
<preformat id="eip-id1169855224292">

<item>Appreciate the importance the Founding Fathers attached to the public need for widespread access to learning and information.</item>
</list><para id="eip-740">Ever practical, the Founding Fathers sought to construct an intellectual property regime that above all else would encourage the growth of commerce and industry in order to ensure the survival of the young American nation during its precarious beginnings.</para><para id="eip-498">For patent law, this meant creating the maximum possible incentives to those whose ingenuity would spur the development of agriculture and domestic industry. As economist Jonathan Hughes once noted, entrepreneur-inventors like Eli Whitney, who developed a cotton gin in 1793 that increased agricultural production a hundredfold, were“the vital few” upon whom the nation depended for progress. That’s why early Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story argued that patent rights were “sacred,” and the just reward for their contributions to society.</para><para id="eip-853">But in copyright law, a different approach was taken—one that acknowledged authors’ rights but placed far greater emphasis on the public’s need for widespread access to learning and on the growth of markets. James Gilreath, the Library of Congress historian who in the late nineteenth century painstakingly reconstructed Thomas Jefferson’s massive library catalog burned by the British in 1814, explained the Founders’ view this way:
<preformat id="eip-id2871581">
       “The constitutional copyright provisions’ emphasis on the useful arts sought not to bolster a 
        professional literary establishment of novelists, poets, and critics such as the one that existed 
        in England, but rather to ensure that books with demonstrably practical benefits to society would 
        be available to readers of the new Republic.”
</preformat></para><para id="eip-992">This emphasis was certainly in tune with the realities of American book trade. Domestic publishers mainly produced newspapers, almanacs, and practical guides—reading material of useful value to a nation that needed to build an entire economy from scratch. Most important literary works, on the other hand, were imported from Britain and France.</para><para id="eip-290">As a result, even in colonial times, states that passed copyright laws did so only with explicit rules that ensured widespread public access to knowledge and information.</para><para id="eip-349">Take colonial Connecticut’s 1783 copyright law, for example. It certainly contained all the right rhetoric about authors’ natural rights:
<preformat id="eip-id988573">
       “Whereas it  is  perfectly  agreeable  to the principles of natural equity and justice, that every
        author should be secured in receiving the profits that may arise from the sale of his works, and

No one failed to get the point.</para><para id="eip-189">After the Constitutional Convention and the establishment of Congress, the first federal copyright statute was signed into law by President George Washington on May 31, 1790, less than two months after the first patent law was approved.</para><para id="eip-812">The law stipulated that “the author and authors of any map, chart, book or books already printed within these United States, being a citizen or citizens thereof, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending such map, chart, book or books” for a period of 14 years, with the right of renewal for another 14 years. The Founders’ belief that 28 years was the proper maximum copyright term stands in sharp contrast to today’s controversial maximum copyright term of life-plus-70 years, an issue we will discuss later in this chapter.</para><para id="eip-7">Anyone violating a copyright “shall forfeit all and every copy and all and every sheet to the author or proprietor who shall forthwith destroy the same.” What’s more, “offenders shall also forfeit and pay the sum of fifty cents for every sheet which shall be found in his or her possession.” As a final disincentive to infringers, the law allowed copyright owners to file suit “in any court of record in the United States within one year after the cause of action.”</para><para id="eip-895">Still, the law’s focus on the public interest was clear in the first five words of the text: <foreign>“An Act for the Encouragement of Learning,</foreign> by securing the Copies of Maps, Charts and Books, to the Authors and Proprietors of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned.”</para><para id="eip-877">The failure in the text to distinguish between “authors” and “proprietors” (i.e., publishers, printers, and booksellers), of course, also suggested that Congress did not view copyright as an innate or moral right of authors. In fact, copyright was conditional upon the author or proprietor depositing a copy of the work in the district court and paying a fee of 60 cents.</para><para id="eip-238">Another sign that the emphasis of U.S. copyright law was to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge over the protection of authors’ inherent property rights was provided by this sentence:
<preformat id="eip-id1165830721642">
       “Nothing in this act shall be construed to extend to prohibit the importation or vending, reprinting

</list><para id="eip-455">During the first century of its existence, the courts repeatedly rejected the idea that copyright law gave priority to the inherent property rights of authors. As the judge in <emphasis><foreign>Koppel
v. Downing</foreign></emphasis> put it in 1897:
<preformat id="eip-id1171490564013">
       “The primary object of this provision is to promote the progress of science and the useful arts, 
        thereby benefitting the public, and as a means to that end and as a secondary object, to secure
        exclusive rights to authors.”
</preformat></para><para id="eip-200">This was, of course, a utilitarian, market-oriented, and quintessentially American way of looking at things. Where copyright promoted the public interest by spreading knowledge and growing markets, it was upheld. Where it hindered those objectives, it was not.</para><para id="eip-730">This idea was nowhere more evident than in the way that courts developed the doctrine of “fair use.” As outlined by Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, “fair use” allowed others to use a portion of a copyrighted work if doing so served the public interest—as in the case of a newspaper discussion of a copyrighted political treatise or a review of a copyrighted collection of poems in a literary journal.</para><para id="eip-450">Interestingly, Justice Story did not say how much of an original work could be copied, and even today there is no agreed-upon limit to the number of words that may be copied under fair use. Instead, Justice Story outlined various factors to be considered in determining whether a use was indeed “fair use” or infringement. These include:</para><list id="eip-420"><item>The purpose of the use (i.e., was it for commercial gain or public benefit?)</item>
<item>“The degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work”</item>
</list><para id="eip-807">“Fair use” would not be formally codified into law until the Copyright Act of 1976, some 150 years later (see “Section 3.8: The Fair Use Doctrine”). Nonetheless, the degree to which fair use was defined in terms of its market impact is typical of the U.S. approach to intellectual property. Whatever promoted economic progress, as patents did, was strongly protected. Whatever hindered that progress, as copyright could potentially do by limiting knowledge diffusion, was less protected. “Fair use was not regarded as an exception to the grant of copyright,” says Khan. “Instead, the grant of copyright comprised a limited exception to the primacy of the public domain.”<footnote id="footnote12">

In what many consider to be the most influential law review article ever written, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis in 1890 argued that one of the oldest principles of common law is that an individual should be secure in his person and his property. But “modern invention and enterprise,” they said, had created unwarranted intrusions into people’s lives that could not be remedied through existing copyright or tort laws. Therefore, a new right was needed: the right to privacy.</para><para id="eip-71">One year later in 1891, the founding case for privacy rights was tried in <link document="m10275" version="2.1">Schuyler v.

</para><para id="eip-964">What, exactly, did copyright have to do with privacy? Warren and Brandeis noted that copyright protection of unpublished works (at the time granted not by federal law, which governed only published works, but by court decisions stemming from <foreign>Donaldson v. Becket</foreign>, mentioned above) was centrally concerned with protecting authors’ decisions about whether to grant the public access to their work. Similarly, the right of privacy protects individuals from unauthorized access to (or use of) their names, portraits, or personal information. In the more than 122 years that have elapsed since that first case, the right of privacy has continued to expand and evolve to offer two protections: the right against invasion of one’s personal privacy, and the right of publicity (the ability to use one’s name or image to market products).</para><para id="eip-866">The larger point here is that throughout U.S. history, the “modern invention and enterprise” that Warren and Brandeis wrote about has forced Congress and the courts to continually make adjustments to copyright law. In 1831, for example, Congress extended copyright to musical compositions, but it wasn’t until 1909—long after the invention of the player  piano and phonograph in the 1870s—that Congress revised copyright law to grant composers the first mechanical reproduction rights to their musical compositions. And although photography could be copyrighted by 1865, a lower court still invalidated Thomas Edison’s copyright of a motion picture as late as 1903—a decision that was quickly overturned by the appellate court.

The term gets its meaning from the word “fringe”—implying a boundary that cannot be crossed. As laid out in Sections 106 through 122 of Title 17 of the U.S. Code and subject to certain exclusions, infringement occurs when a person copies, distributes, performs, or displays all or part of a copyrighted work (or in the world of television, conducts a secondary transmission of a cable system without the express consent of the cable system owner). Copyright infringement requires proof of two things. First, it requires proof that the defendant actually copied from the plaintiff’s work. That makes it different than patent infringement, which can take place even if the defendant independently came up with the invention that was patented by the plaintiff. Proof of copying can be obtained either directly, by the defendant admitting his act, or, indirectly, by showing that he had access to the plaintiff’s work, and that there are similarities between the works that make independent creation unlikely. Second, infringement requires proof that the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to the plaintiff’s work.<footnote id="footnote27">

The second requirement is there to make clear that not all copying amounts to infringement. For example, copying of a general theme, such as a detective solving a murder mystery, would not be considered infringement.</para><para id="eip-780">There are two ways to demonstrate the similarity of an allegedly infringing work and the original copyrighted work. “Fragmented literal similarity” may be shown by demonstrating that the infringing work contains specific copied elements of the original work. For example, suppose that one travel writer wrote a guide to Florida that contained a chapter on Key West, and a second writer copied that chapter and included it in his otherwise independently researched and written guide to Florida. In that case, we could point to specific sentences and paragraphs in the two works that were identical, even if other sentences and paragraphs were not.</para><para id="eip-559">Or, to take another example, in today’s music scene, certain genres of music use pieces or “samples” of previous sound recordings that are then mixed into a new sound recording. Unless the artist doing the sampling licenses the sound recording (and maybe the underlying musical work as well), the sampling could be considered infringing.</para><para id="eip-318"><title>Copyright Infringement in the Music Industry</title>Take Kanye West, for example.

In the case of a novel, for example, one author might infringe by copying the plot of another novel, even though he used different words to describe the action taking place. Similarly, a composer of a song might write lyrics and music that closely borrowed patterns from another song, even though he did not use the exact same words and notes.</para><para id="eip-147">Again, take Kanye West. He was also recently sued by Vincent Peters, a local Chicago artist, not for sampling his music but rather for employing substantially similar concepts and wording in Kanye’s megahit “Stronger.” The judge did not agree, finding that Kanye’s song had actually used concepts and phrasing that were “common ideas” and in the public domain—specifically, Friedrich Nietzsche’s phrase, “That which does not kill us makes us stronger.”<footnote id="footnote28">

But those changes were small compared with the enormous advances of the twentieth century. The invention of radio, broadcast television, cable television, the video cassette recorder (VCR), personal computers, computer software and video games, digital audio recorders, compact discs, the digital video recorder (DVR), the Internet, iTunes  media  players, and now the streaming of music and movies all offered consumers new forms of creative content—and offered creators a new means of reproducing and distributing it. Each of these required an adjustment in U.S. copyright law.</para><para id="eip-91">Take the advent of cable television in the 1960s and 1970s. Early court cases like <link document="m10275" version="2.1"><foreign>Fortnightly Corp. v.

It also mandated that royalties be paid to copyright owners for every device sold.</para><para id="eip-404">When it came to performance rights— one of the six exclusive rights of copyright owners—the last 150 years have witnessed major changes in the way musical performances are distributed and consumed. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) was formed in 1914 to develop a system whereby royalties could be obtained for composers whose songs were performed live—and later on, over the newly invented technology of radio. Today, 435,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers rely upon ASCAP to secure royalties for their work performed over TV, CD, and every new media that has come after radio.</para><para id="eip-884">The other three performing rights organizations are SESAC, formed in 1930; Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), formed in 1939; and SoundExchange, which in 2007 was granted the sole right by the Copyright Royalty Board to represent performers whose music airs on satellite radio (such as SIRIUS XM), Internet radio (like Pandora), cable TV music channels, and similar platforms for streaming sound recordings. The Recording Industry of America Association (RIAA), formed in 1952, represents record labels and music distributors and has played an important role in ensuring that their rights are respected even as new technologies for distributing recorded music have emerged.</para><para id="eip-516">The RIAA lobbied Congress to enact the <emphasis>No Electronic Theft Act of 1997</emphasis>, for example, which made it a criminal offense to reproduce or distribute music by electronic means (i.e., over the Internet). Nonetheless, by 2002, some 3.6 billion songs a month were still being downloaded illegally, thanks to music sharing sites like Napster, which had been launched in 1999 and at its peak facilitated the downloading (much of it illegal) of 80 million songs. Indeed, many college dormitory networks became overloaded with MP3 musical file transfers.
</para><para id="eip-956">At the time, many Internet pundits, enthralled with the misquoted notion that “information wants to be free” online, insisted that downloading technology made it impossible for musicians and their labels to enforce their copyrights on the Internet. For its part, Napster claimed that they should not be held responsible for any illegal downloading committed by users.</para><para id="eip-385">But the RIAA and musicians brought suits for contributory infringement. In court cases like <link document="m10275" version="2.1"><foreign>A &amp; M Records. v.

But in place of Napster, music consumers now have legal music download sites such as Apple’s iTunes music store that sell digital music with permission from, and appropriate royalties to, their copyright owners. Surveys show that most consumers don’t really want to steal music. They just want convenient, low-cost online access to it. Most consumers also appear to recognize that if music creators cannot make a living from their work, they won’t be able to keep making music.</para><para id="eip-834">Meanwhile, digital rights management (DRM) technologies had been developed that have the potential to limit the piracy of copyrighted content. Companies in various content industries lobbied Congress to pass the <emphasis>Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (DMCA)</emphasis>. This law made it a crime to disseminate technology or services that could circumvent DRM measures used to control access to copyrighted movies, music, and books. It also increased penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet.
</para><para id="eip-205">But in an appropriate concession to online services that merely hosted user content, the DMCA limited the liability of online services for copyright infringement committed by their users, so long as they acted to remove the offending content once informed of it.</para><para id="eip-224"><title>Viacom vs. YouTube</title>In 2007, however, Viacom filed suit against YouTube and its corporate parent Google for copyright infringement, claiming that the popular video-sharing site was committing “massive intentional copyright infringement” for not taking sufficient steps to prevent or remove some 160,000 unauthorized clips of Viacom’s entertainment programming posted by users. Google argued that the DMCA’s “safe harbor” provisions shielded them from liability for the actions of its users, and a district court judge ruled in favor of Google in 2010. But in April of 2012, a court of appeals vacated that decision and ruled that Viacom had presented enough evidence to warrant a trial. Viacom was seeking more than $1 <foreign>billion</foreign> in damages from YouTube, but in March of 2014, the parties quietly settled the seven-year-old case.</para><para id="eip-247">A key factor in spurring the settlement is that Google has in the interim addressed the concerns of content owners like Viacom by creating a system that allows them to track their content when posted on YouTube and then request it be taken down or run with ads.</para><para id="eip-526"><title>Extending Copyrights</title>The same year that saw passage of the DMCA also witnessed the passage of the <emphasis>Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act</emphasis>, which added an additional 20 years to the term of copyright—extending it for most works to the life of the author plus 70 years after the author is deceased. Critics called it the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” because it effectively extended the copyrights of many of the characters and content of the Walt Disney Company, which lobbied strongly for the bill. They argued that copyright law was historically designed to serve a public purpose and ought to defer to the public interest, as it has throughout U.S. history. As the <foreign>New York Times</foreign> put it:
<preformat id="eip-id7360724">
       “When Senator Hatch laments that George Gershwin’s ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ 
        will soon ‘fall into the public domain,’ he makes the public domain 
        sound like a dark abyss where songs go, never to be heard again. In 
        fact, when a work enters the public domain it means the public can 
        afford to use it freely, to give it new currency.”

</para><para id="eip-758">Even a staunch defender of intellectual property rights like Professor Richard Epstein of the NYU School of Law—he was rated one of the top legal thinkers of modern times by the journal <foreign>Legal Affairs</foreign>—believes that the copyright term of life- plus-70s years is too long.</para><para id="eip-315">“My own view is that no commercial property right should ever be tied to life, and the extra 70 years is far too long,” he argues. “It has the potential to create an  anti-commons that deprives the public of its rights to freely access cultural works. Copyrighted works should pass into the public domain after 28 years, which was the approach of the Founders.”</para><para id="eip-319">The debate over the Copyright Term Extension Act, not surprisingly, continues.</para><para id="eip-342">In the international sphere, meanwhile, the late twentieth century also saw the United States finally agree to the <emphasis>Berne Convention</emphasis> in 1988, joining the following year. The purpose of the convention is to ensure fair and reciprocal copyright protection for member nations. Although it did not create an international copyright per se, it did require the United States to amend its copyright law to comply with certain Berne provisions, such as a ban on registration as a condition of copyright. But overall, the convention facilitated the reciprocal cross-border protection of creative works while leaving most details of each nation’s copyright laws to member states.
</para><para id="eip-376">One proposed bill that didn’t make it into law was the <foreign>Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act of 2002</foreign>. It attempted to deal with continuing piracy of copyrighted works by requiring every medium and every device for the consumption of copyrighted works to implement digital rights management (DRM) technology. But the bill was considered too draconian—too <foreign>1984</foreign>, if you will—and failed to pass.</para><para id="eip-231">To be sure, many companies have voluntarily implemented elements of DRM technology, to the chagrin of many consumers. Some electronic book readers (e-books) limit the ability of users to read books only on those devices, preventing interoperability between Kindle and iPad e-book readers, for example. Some music labels install software on their CDs to prevent copying of the music. And some Blu-ray and DVD movie players do not allow for the creation of transformative copies. In fact, iTunes, a very popular way to manage music and other media, used to employ a DRM system that limited the transfer of songs to five authorized computers.</para><para id="eip-766">Groups like the Free Software Foundation argue that “The motive for DRM schemes is to increase profits for those who impose them, but their profit is a side issue when millions of people’s freedom is at stake.” But their argument is undercut by the simple reality that if content creators can’t make a living from it, most will stop creating and take day jobs to pay the rent. This has always been the copyright bargain in America—protection for the rights of creators but only so long as it serves the public interest.</para><para id="eip-470">And enabling creators to keep creating is clearly in the public interest.</para><para id="eip-180"><title>E-Books</title>A more legitimate concern regarding DRM is that, whatever its perceived benefits for publishers and distributors, it is holding back innovation and consumer rights in digital content industries. This is especially evident in the burgeoning e-book market, which exploded from barely 10 percent of U.S. book sales in 2011 to 30 percent of all book sales by 2013. But a growing number of e-book publishers have now concluded that unless they meet consumer demands to ease these DRM anti-piracy provisions, further growth could be constrained.
</para><para id="eip-862">According to Microsoft’s Chief Intellectual Property Strategy Counsel Tom Rubin, a leading voice on this issue, that’s because DRM makes the e-book reader experience much less enjoyable and useful than that for printed books. According to Rubin:
<preformat id="eip-id1168195886225">
       “When I buy a printed book, I can choose where 
        to buy it—whether from a small neighborhood 
        bookstore, a large chain bookstore, a grocery 
        store, drug store, other retail establishment, 
        or an online retailer. I can even buy books at 
        a steep discount by going to second-hand 
        stores, garage sales, and flea markets.

       "You can't do that with an ebook.

       “Then after I buy a print book and bring it 
        home, I can write notes in the margin, share 
        those passages or even the whole book with 
        friends and colleagues, and even photocopy a 
        few pages for my book club.

       “You can’t do that with an ebook.”
</preformat>

        </para><para id="eip-306">Rubin says the fault here lies not in the technology, which already exists to enable these capabilities in e-books and also augment them with rich audio, video, and social media. Rather, it lies in the business arrangements underlying the publication and distribution of e-books.</para><para id="eip-215">The e-book you buy, for example, is often available from only one source—and usually only readable on one proprietary device. You can’t access it from any device you want, nor can you use the e-reader app of your choice. This balkanization of the market diverts resources from enhancing the user experience into defending the turf of incumbent players.</para><para id="eip-759">But it’s not just the balkanization of the market that hinders competition and  innovation. Some publishers now believe that the digital rights management (DRM) controls they employ to prevent piracy are actually preventing many consumers from fully embracing e-books. After all, as many book buyers have angrily noted, you can’t even download the digital version of a print book that you’ve already purchased unless you pay a second time.</para><para id="eip-51"><title>Publishing DRM Free</title><preformat id="eip-id1167874079893">

For the first few years after the launch of the iTunes music store in 2003, piracy-wary music publishers required Apple to sell its songs with DRM controls that limited the kind and number of devices consumers could play them on.</para><para id="eip-265">But on February 6, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote an open letter to the industry urging music publishers to let iTunes sell music DRM free:
<preformat id="eip-id1169642742619">
       “DRMs haven’t worked, and may never work, to halt music 
        piracy. If such requirements were removed, the music

</preformat></para><para id="eip-660">This, said Jobs, would obviously be “positive for the music companies.”</para><para id="eip-520">And sure enough, once publishers agreed to license digital music DRM free later that same year, the market exploded.

<preformat id="eip-id1170516399865">
       “Success [for ebook publishers] can only come with

 </list><para id="eip-184">One of the newest technology challenges facing copyright law concerns royalty rates for streaming music online. As it stands, royalty rates are much lower for music played over satellite and cable radio outlets like Sirius XM than they are for music streaming services like Pandora.</para><para id="eip-331"><title>Music Streaming</title>Rates are set by the federal Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), a three-judge panel, but currently they apply a different rate for streaming music than they do  for satellite and cable music. Sirius pays about 8 percent of its revenue to record companies and artists. Pandora, however, claims it must pay a rate per song streamed that amounts to 44 percent of revenue. So it pushed for the introduction in September 2012 of the Internet Radio Fairness Act, which would make the rates for Internet radio companies the same as those for satellite and cable radio.</para><para id="eip-5">This bill was opposed not only by many musical artists and their organizations, but by many copyright experts as well. In November of 2012, a who’s who of musicians and singers—including stars from Motown, rock and roll, country, rap, and jazz—published an open letter in <foreign>Billboard</foreign> magazine opposing Pandora’s plan to cut artists’ pay and make more money, as they put it in the letter, “on the backs of hard working musicians and singers.”</para><para id="eip-920">In November of 2013, Pandora quietly abandoned efforts to seek legislation that would help reduce the royalties paid to rights holders. Instead of pursuing legislation, Pandora said it will focus its efforts on lobbying the CRB.</para><para id="eip-356">In early December 2015, the music industry waited breathlessly for the CRB’s decision on royalty rates. Pandora had petitioned the CRB to reduce the current statutory rate of 14 cents per 100 songs to 11 cents per 100 songs starting in 2016. But music labels and artists represented by a royalty collection organization called SoundExchange wanted the statutory royalty rate raised to 25 cents per 100 songs—an 80 percent increase— and then by 1 cent every year after that until 2020. Collectively, music streaming services have a combined listenership of 100 million people and are the fastest-growing revenue source for artists and music labels.
</para><para id="eip-300">On December 16, 2015, in a victory for record labels and artists, the CRB ruled that online radio firms will have to pay 17 cents per 100 plays of songs through 2020.</para><para id="eip-434"><title>TV Streaming</title>Another new technology challenge to copyright involved television broadcasters and an upstart television service called Aereo that at one point rented dime-sized antennas for $8 per month that act like long-range rabbit ears to people with digital video recorders, enabling them to watch and record over-the-air network channels like NBC or Fox without paying the much-larger fees for cable or satellite service.</para><para id="eip-183">TV broadcasters argued that Aereo violated their copyrights by rebroadcasting their TV signals. Aereo, however, claimed that it was the subscribers who were doing the transmitting, and that Aereo merely rented a tool that enabled people to watch a private performance—much like they do when they tape a TV show and watch it in their living room.</para><para id="eip-767">The case, which had the TV and technology industries on edge, was decided in their favor on June 25, 2014, by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that Aereo had infringed the rights of copyright holders.

</list><para id="eip-568">Up to now, we have focused on traditional copyright situations in which an author usually pursues some sort of monetary gain in exchange for the use of his creative work as well as situations in which the author also wants to prevent any alteration of his work. But what if an author simply wants to get his work out before the broadest possible readership and monetary gain is not an issue? What if an author would welcome others adding to his original work? In these cases, there are new kinds of copyright licenses that may be employed by authors.</para><para id="eip-609"><title>Creative Commons</title>The development of the <emphasis>Creative Commons</emphasis> represents a voluntary private sector alternative to traditional copyright that coordinates the creation and consumption of content among a wide variety of individuals and institutions—all without a hint of government intervention. In doing so, Creative Commons captures a whole section of the market for which broad dissemination of content and not financial gain is key, which is something that could not be done as effectively by either traditional copyright or the public domain.</para><para id="eip-94">The Creative Commons License is currently available in six flavors:</para><para id="eip-881">All of these licenses require the work to be copyrighted because the Creative Commons license is based on copyright. Although Creative Commons licenses can provide authors with added opportunities to have their work distributed and used, these licenses do not allow authors to limit any of the rights otherwise available under copyright law, such as fair use.</para><para id="eip-975">Creative Commons licenses also cannot be revoked, which means that if copies of your work are distributed under a Creative Commons license, they will always be distributed that way. If, for example, you distribute your amazing new video under a Creative Commons license and it generates five million page views on YouTube—and then 20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox offers you a seven-figure deal for exclusive rights to distribute your video— you will not be able to prevent everyone on the planet from continuing to distribute your video for free on the Internet.</para><para id="eip-431"><title>Open Access</title>Another alternative copyright approach is called open access, founded by the Budapest Open Access Initiative in 2002. Open access encourages scholars to provide the fruits of their research online without expectation of payment.<footnote id="footnote46">

The aim here is to open up scholarly research far more widely than is currently the case, but open access adherents face a key challenge in the fact that many scholarly articles are published in expensive journals as “works made for hire.” This means that the rights belong to the journals, not the authors. But open access supporters are working with publishers to try to overcome this limitation and create more opportunities for scholarly research to be made more widely accessible at lower cost.</para><para id="eip-299">Finally, open source software licensing also offers an alternative to traditional copyright. An open source license for computer software allows the source code to be used, modified, and/or shared under certain defined terms and conditions set by the Open Source Initiative, an educational, advocacy, and stewardship organization formed in 1998. An open source license allows end users to modify the source code for their own purposes.
